# FREEDOM

There is but one duty!  
There is but one thing that determines rightness in moral conduct.
There is but one commandment.
There is but one obligation, liability, onus,
burden, load, responsibility, decree, dictate,
accountableness, charge, weight, encumbrance, pressure.  
...  
**THATS FREEDOM!**


## MORAL
> the freedom of one beeing end where the freedom of others start

Simply put, nothing is morally wrong.  Neither the free
man nor the unfree man can perform an act that is morally
wrong.  All acts have a potential, and where a person strives
to fulfill it's potential, a moral wrong cannot occur, since
freedom is being asserted.

Acts which neither
hinder nor promote freedom have no basis in it and,
therefore, are excluded from the determination of morality
altogether.

As said before, EVERY act has a
potential, and where a person strives to fulfill that
potential, a moral wrong cannot occur.  The consequences of
that action are immaterial and irrelevant, the action itself
is what determines rightness in moral conduct.  Moral wrongs,
then, would not exist in any action, despite it's
consequences.


Syllogism 1A2A

     Integration of disorder leads to freedom
     Freedom is good
     Integration of disorder is good


Syllogism 1A2A2B

     Heresy exhibits religious freedom
     Religious freedom is good
     Heresy is good


Discordian Ethics
    - Rightness of an action is based on freedom of the
    action
    - There are no moral wrongs
    - Consequences are irrelevant to ethics
    - Actions which have no basis in freedom have no basis
    in ethics

## DISORDER

To understand how freedom is enhanced by the integration
of disorder, please re-read the first two paragraphs of this
section, on systems' order and disorder.  When disordered
information is sent into an incomplete ordered system, it can
be integrated, and this integration can only take place
freely.  Until an individual notices the potential of this
disordered information, the potential cannot be fulfilled.
The ordered information will deal only with other ordered
information, since it would not be able to understand the
disorder.  Only after an individual realizes that this
disorder can be used will it be integrated into the system.
This is a free integration, the only kind of integration
possible.




Systems are made up of Order and Disorder.  A system
that contains only ordered information is incomplete, as is a
system that contains only disordered entropy.  (This is not
incomplete as a car without an engine is incomplete, but
incomplete as a hydrogen atom is without an neutron.  It is
not "unfinished", it simply "does not contain all parts".)
The brain is such a system.  If the brain receives only
ordered information, it would never be capable of filling-in-
the-blanks.  If the brain only receives static images of
disordered entropy, it will never be able to learn.

This is the driving force behind many Discordian
practices.  Knowing that the general public has an excellent
idea of order but no clue as to how to appreciate disorder,
disordered information is sent randomly into society in
various forms to compete with the opposition.

The effect of disorder on an ordered structure can serve
two discordian concepts:
* First: the ordered structure can collapse  
* Second: the new data can be integrated and modify the ordered structure

The breakdown of a structure is sometimes deemed necessary, but
more often than not it appears as though the structure should
at least remain intact, and new information just be gradually
accepted into the structure.  This would give a greater
"value" to the whole structure, as it would be more readily
able to accept further disordered information.

=> 

The application for a Discordian, then, would be to
force disordered information into a society without the
society invalidating itself, so that it gives either the
society as a whole or individual members of that society the
chance for greater freedom.  Whether the potentials of those
freedoms hinder or contradict each other is irrelevant, the
freedom itself is the aim of the Discordian's actions.

(Note, however, that this is not the only action that
can be derived from the theory; there are other possible
courses of action in, it seems, an infinite number.  Since
any given action has a certain potential, if there are an
infinite number of possible actions, then there are an
infinite number of possible potentials that could be filled.
The ability for enhancing freedom by composing disordered
information is merely one of these possible potentials, and
is not part of ethics itself.)
